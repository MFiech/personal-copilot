</ol><p class="no-margin"><b>Example 1.</b></p>
<p class="no-margin">The guest wants to come in a camper in which there will be 3 people. According to your price list, the camper costs €20, and the stay of one person costs €10. You set the basic price as €30 (camper + 1 person), and set the Extra fee for an additional person at €10 for every Guest above 1. Therefore, when making a reservation, the price per night for a camper and 3 people will be €50 (€30+10+10). </p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Example 2.</b></p>
<p class="no-margin">A guest would like to come to the glamping tent in a group of 4 people. The basic price is €100 for a tent with 2 people, and each additional person is charged an additional €25. In the base price set €100, the Extra fee for an additional person you set: €25 for every Guest above 2. Therefore, the final price for 4 people per one night will be €150 (€100+25+25).</p>
