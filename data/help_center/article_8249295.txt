Title: How to synchronize AlohaCamp’s calendar with other booking platforms?
Body: <p class="no-margin">To have control over your reservations and avoid overbooking, we recommend synchronizing your calendar with other platforms or channel managers. By synchronizing calendars, you are assured that your calendar is always updated and your guests don't have to worry that the date they are interested in is already taken. In addition, with a synchronized calendar calendar, you don't have to verify the availability of every single reservation that enters, which saves you a lot of time.</p>
<p class="no-margin">Synchronization is very simple, it is a matter of exchanging links and takes a few minutes.</p>

With this, you won’t have to confirm every reservation that enters and save you and your Guests time. Instant reservations speed up the decision-making process for Guests, resulting in more bookings. To read more about it and to learn how to activate this feature, <a href="https://help.alohacamp.com/en/articles/8249916-instant-booking" target="_blank" class="intercom-content-link">click here.</a></p>

<p class="no-margin"><b>Why doesn't the synchronization work?</b></p>
<p class="no-margin">These are the most common errors that cause calendars to not synchronize correctly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>One-way synchronization</b> - only the external calendar has been imported into AlohaCamp, but our link has not been exported to the other calendar. This only allows us to synchronize external bookings in the AlohaCamp calendar, but will not send our booking information to the external calendars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Manual bookings</b> - please note that manually added bookings on platforms such as Booking or Airbnb are not synchronized. These portals do not send us a signal about these bookings and therefore the dates will not be blocked. For this reason, we suggest adding manual bookings to the AlohaCamp calendar, as our system sends information about these bookings to external calendars.</p>
<p class="no-margin">It is also possible to activate such an option in Booking. Instructions are given in point 5: <a href="https://partner.booking.com/en-us/help/rates-availability/extranet-calendar/syncing-your-bookingcom-calendar-third-party-calendars" target="_blank" class="intercom-content-link">click here</a> (book and closed dates).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Include links to all external calendars</b> - if you don't use Channel Manager that connects all your calendars and only have links to specific platforms, be sure to include them all. Example: Syncing your calendar with Booking itself will not show Airbnb bookings in AlohaCamp, even though they are visible in the calendar on Booking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Timeout</b> - remember that the synchronization does not run every minute. The synchronization of the blocks occurs at different intervals and depends on the platform or the specific channel manager. Importing a new external link to the AlohaCamp calendar will work very quickly and external bookings will appear immediately, but, for example, the average waiting time for a block downloaded in Airbnb to be released is about 15 minutes.</p>
