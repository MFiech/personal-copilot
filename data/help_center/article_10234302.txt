Title: Overpricing
Body: <h2 id="h_d02a3ec93a">1. Why do we check prices?</h2>
<p class="no-margin">Promoting properties on AlohaCamp is an area we continually develop as our platform grows in popularity. We invest significant effort and resources to provide Hosts with maximum visibility and reach a wide audience of potential Guests. Our goal is to maximize the effectiveness of promotional activities that attract Guests and generate as many bookings as possible.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Price consistency is a key factor here—properties with inflated prices lose attractiveness to Guests who compare offers across different sales channels. When prices on AlohaCamp are consistent with those offered on other sales channels, the offer becomes transparent and builds trust among Guests, which translates into more effective promotion and increased bookings.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<h2 id="h_5f0296ee7a">2. How often do we check prices?</h2>
<p class="no-margin">We regularly monitor prices on other sales channels to ensure they are consistent with the offers on AlohaCamp. These checks are conducted monthly or quarterly, depending on the popularity of the property.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<h2 id="h_5a4f413255">3. What are the acceptable price differences, and how are prices compared with other channels?</h2>
<p class="no-margin">An acceptable price difference between AlohaCamp and other sales channelsis up to 5%. This margin accounts for different pricing policies or rounding differences and is fully understandable.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<ul><li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Comparing prices with Booking.com</b></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">When comparing prices, we match the price of the property for a specific date on Booking.com (excluding Genius discounts) with the price on AlohaCamp (excluding the AlohaCamp service fee).</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Genius discounts on Booking.com are a promotional tool designed to attract Guests with significant discounts fully covered by the Host's margin. This program requires Hosts to offer an additional discount (ranging from 10% to 20%) on top of the standard Booking.com commission, which can be as high as 17%. As a result, the total cost for the Host can exceed 25% of the booking value.</p>
</li></ul><p class="no-margin"></p>
<ul><li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Airbnb vs. AlohaCamp</b></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">The price on Airbnb, including their service fee (and other fees included in the final price), is compared with the price on AlohaCamp, which excludes the service fee for Guests (with any mandatory fees included).</p>
</li></ul><p class="no-margin"></p>
<ul><li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Own websites and other channels</b></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">The price on AlohaCamp, excluding the service fee, should be the same as the price listed on the Host's own website and other sales channels.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">If Guests on other channels are required to pay additional fees on top of the base reservation price, the Host must provide screenshots confirming the mandatory fees visible to the Guest.</p>
</li></ul><p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<h2 id="h_f34b18c885">4. Communication with the Host</h2>
<p class="no-margin">If a property is flagged as not complying with the pricing policy, the Host receives three emails within a week. The first email informs the Host of the need to adjust the price, while subsequent emails serve as reminders of the approaching deadline for making the changes. Each email contains details of the required adjustments and guidelines for aligning prices with the platform’s standards.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">If the price is not corrected within a week, the Host receives an email detailing the consequences that have been applied. This email will also include information about further steps to restore the property’s full functionality on the platform.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<h2 id="h_1acdc416ad">5. What happens if a property does not align its prices with other sales channels?</h2>
<p class="no-margin">If the price discrepancy is not corrected within a week after notifying the Host, the following measures may be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Temporary reduction of the property's visibility in the algorithm (from 80% to 95%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Permanent reduction of the property's visibility in the algorithm (from 80% to 95%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Suspension of participation in the AlohaFriends and AlohaPhoto programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Suspension of paid promotional campaigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Suspension of promotion on social media and newsletters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Changing the property's name to a generic one, making it harder for Guests to find the property on other platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">In the final instance, deactivation of the property on the platform.</p>
</li>
</ul><p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<h2 id="h_60b3a7daf4">6. How to notify us about updated prices?</h2>
<p class="no-margin">If you receive a notification stating that your prices violate the pricing policy, you will see the following message whenever you edit your pricing:</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<div class="intercom-container"><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/xa8cb3gu/1279016105/54fe78a20fcd2d4375bfabe7e9f1/image.png?expires=1740333600&amp;signature=66aaf8eafea3b14cc9122c9f0f9129a6b6bc849a65a702da1ea6122c1a3c9935&amp;req=dSIgH8l%2Fm4BfXPMW1HO4zUWM0kVWB9QwnuGQ2ufad7Y7UwR7Oz7VLJFW5UyS%0Aqynn%0A"></div><p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">To inform us about the price adjustments, check the "<b>I confirm that the prices are aligned now and the price at AlohaCamp is not higher than in other channels.</b>" box and click the "<b>Request price verification</b>" button. After saving the changes, our team will automatically receive a verification request, which will take up to <b>two business days</b>. Once the price alignment is confirmed, any imposed measures will be lifted.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">If you receive another notification during the verification process, no further action is needed—your price update will already be in the system. Simply wait for our response.</p>
<p class="no-margin">You can also notify us by email, either by replying to previous correspondence or by writing to us at <a target="_blank" class="intercom-content-link">hello@alohacamp.com</a> to confirm that the changes have been made correctly.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<h2 id="h_9ff5b5688b">7. Other cases</h2>
<p class="no-margin">If price differences arise due to technical limitations related to pricing settings on sales channels or channel managers, please inform us by email. Each case will be reviewed individually.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">In such cases, we may request detailed information about the property's setup on another sales channel, including screenshots. This information will help us identify and implement the missing features on our platform to better meet Hosts' needs.</p>
