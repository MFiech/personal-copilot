Title: How does the search algorithm work on AlohaCamp?
Body: <p class="no-margin">If your property's offer is ready and has been published on our platform, it's time to attract the attention of potential Guests. Customers use the browser on our website to find the perfect spot in Nature. Therefore, we would like to show you how you can raise your property's position in the search results and reach even more Guests who visit your property's profile and choose to stay at your place.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Our search results depend on the availability of properties, responsiveness of Hosts and other factors to improve the final Guest experience. The amount of your commission does not affect your position on AlohaCamp.</p>

<p class="no-margin"><b>Open up!</b></p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Your property's availability is one of the key considerations when Guests are browsing. If your property is busy for the upcoming season, be sure to open your calendar for future seasons. Without availability, Guests will not be able to make reservations and enjoy their stay at your place. We recommend opening the calendar 12 months ahead so that everyone can find something for themselves well in advance. Properties with low availability will land on the further pages of the browser.</p>

<p class="no-margin">What attracts Guests' attention are high-quality photos, revealing the uniqueness of your property. Carefully selected photographs highlight the unique features and atmosphere, making potential Guests fully appreciate the beauty and comfort of the place you offer. This is a key element that makes your offer one of a kind and clearly differentiates it from the other ones.

<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Guests appreciate the ease of communication with Hosts and definitely do not like to wait. Respond quickly to reservations and accept them. An updated calendar and price list will help you, as well as notifications that are always sent to you. Don't reject reservation requests and leave them unanswered. With the quality of your service, provide the experience you would like to have as a Guest yourself, and your customers will surely repay you with a 5-star review.</p>

<p class="no-margin">We mustn't forget that it's not only Nature around the property that attracts Guests to it. Take care of the amenities and describe exactly what you offer, emphasizing the uniqueness of your offer. Take care of proper equipment, access, parking and a smooth check-in process. Also remember to have a good internet connection, as many of our Guests travel with the purpose of working remotely. This will also enable them to share the experience on their social media, which in turn will provide you with additional promotion.</p>
