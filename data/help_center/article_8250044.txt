<p class="no-margin"><b>7 days after booking or later: </b>you have already received the amount of the booking, so it is the Host who has to return it manually to the Guest. The commission previously charged by AlohaCamp will be automatically refunded to your account at the time of cancellation (it takes 1-3 days to arrive). In this way, you will receive in two transfers the full amount that the Guest has paid. In the chat provided ask for the Guest's data needed to make the transfer.</p>
