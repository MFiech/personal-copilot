Title: Service fee
Body: <h3 id="h_5fa4ab6460"><b>What is the service fee, and how does it affect your billing?</b></h3>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin">The service fee is an amount added to every reservation made by our Guests. This fee is entirely managed and processed by AlohaCamp. We are responsible for issuing the corresponding invoice and handling the entire process. <b>The service fee does not affect the amount of your commission or any other aspect of your billing.</b> The service fee is not transferred to the Host’s account.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin"></p>
<p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin"><b>Example of billing for a 2-night reservation:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin">Total amount paid by the Guest: <b>1050 EUR</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin">Reservation amount: <b>1000 EUR</b> (2x500 EUR per night)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin">Service fee: <b>50 EUR</b><br>​</p>
</li>
</ul><p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin">AlohaCamp’s commission will be calculated from the 1000 EUR reservation amount. The Guest will receive an invoice from AlohaCamp for the 50 EUR service fee, while the Host will bill the Guest for the 1000 EUR reservation amount.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin"></p>
<p class="intercom-align-justify no-margin">In the case of advance payments, the service fee is always added to the total amount of the first payment. For example, if the advance payment is 50%, the Guest will pay 550 EUR through the platform (500 EUR + 50 EUR service fee). The remaining amount of 500 EUR must be paid directly to the Host.</p>
