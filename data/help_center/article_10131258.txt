<p class="no-margin"><b>How to split the received transfer into the booking and tourist tax amounts?</b></p>
<p class="no-margin">After receiving a transfer, you can easily divide the total amount into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Booking amount</b> – this covers the fee guests pay for their stay at your property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Tourist tax</b> – the additional fee, if mandatory in your location.</p>
</li>
</ol><p class="no-margin">Both of these amounts are visible on the <i>Billing</i> page. There, you’ll find detailed information for each reservation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">The total amount paid by the guests,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">The tourist tax amount,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">The total transfer amount you received.</p>
</li>
</ul><p class="no-margin">This allows you to easily manage your earnings and have full insight into how much of the transfer represents the tourist tax and how much is your rental income.</p>
