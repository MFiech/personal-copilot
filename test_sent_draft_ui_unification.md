# Sent Draft UI Unification - Test Instructions

## What was implemented:
Unified the UI appearance of sent drafts to match the thread item design, ensuring consistency between single sent email drafts and sent emails within threads.

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Created `renderThreadItem()` helper function**
- Renders both emails and drafts using the same thread item UI
- Shows avatar, sender name, date, status chip
- Handles expanded/collapsed content display
- Consistent styling for both scenarios

### 2. **Modified `renderDraftContent()` function**  
- **Sent drafts** (`draft.status === 'closed'`): Use thread item UI
- **Active drafts**: Continue using the original bordered box UI
- Transform sent draft data to work with thread item renderer

### 3. **Updated header title**
- **Sent drafts**: Shows "Sent Email" or "Created Event" 
- **Active drafts**: Shows "Email Draft" or "Event Draft"

## How it now works:

### **Single Sent Email Draft:**
1. Click on sent email draft tile → opens right sidebar
2. **NEW**: Uses thread item UI (avatar, sender "You", date, "Sent" chip)
3. Shows expanded email content by default
4. **Consistent** with sent emails in threads

### **Single Active Email Draft:**
1. Click on active email draft tile → opens right sidebar  
2. **UNCHANGED**: Uses bordered box UI with send button
3. Maintains existing functionality for editing/sending

### **Sent Email in Thread:**
1. **UNCHANGED**: Already uses thread item UI
2. Now **matches** the single sent draft appearance

## Test Steps:

### **Test 1: Single Sent Draft**
1. Find a sent email draft (status = 'closed')
2. Click the draft tile in conversation
3. **Verify**: Right sidebar shows thread item UI
4. **Verify**: Avatar shows "You", status chip shows "Sent"
5. **Verify**: Header shows "Sent Email" or "Created Event"
6. **Verify**: Content is expanded and properly formatted

### **Test 2: Single Active Draft** 
1. Find an active email draft (status = 'active')
2. Click the draft tile in conversation
3. **Verify**: Right sidebar shows bordered box UI (unchanged)
4. **Verify**: Send button is visible and functional
5. **Verify**: Header shows "Email Draft" or "Event Draft"

### **Test 3: Visual Consistency**
1. Compare single sent draft UI with sent email in thread
2. **Verify**: Both use identical thread item styling
3. **Verify**: Avatar, sender name, date formatting match
4. **Verify**: Status chips and colors are consistent

## Key Benefits:
✅ **Unified user experience**: Sent items look the same regardless of origin  
✅ **Visual consistency**: No confusing different designs for same concept  
✅ **Maintained functionality**: Active drafts still fully editable  
✅ **Logical grouping**: Sent drafts treated as emails in UI  

## Technical Implementation:
- **Reused existing code**: No duplication, leveraged thread item renderer
- **Conditional rendering**: Smart detection of sent vs active drafts  
- **Data transformation**: Draft data adapted to work with email renderer
- **Minimal changes**: Only modified what was necessary
