description: Everytime I ask to push new changes to the repository, obey the below rules.
globs: 
alwaysApply: false

CRITICAL: ALWAYS run a complete set of automated tests (instruction in ../README_TESTING.md) BEFORE any git push command.

CRITICAL: Never commit the changes directly to the "main" branch. ALWAYS push the changes on a separate feature branch. I'll create manually a PR out of it, wait for the tests, and then marge it.

# How do we start working on a new feature?
    1. If you're on other feature branch, stage the changes and checkout to main.
    2. Pull the newest version of main.
    3. Create a new feature branch with descriptive branch name.
    4. Start working on the feature.
    5. Until requested, do not commit the changes automatically.

# How do we push local changes to the remote repository?    
    1. Always make sure that you're on a correct feature branch with the changes.
    2. Stage all modified files.
    3. Write a description commit title and description. Make sure the title/description is about all changes on the branch, not only recent changes.
    4. Push the branch to the remote repository.
        myenvmfiech@Michas-MacBook-Pro-2 PM Co-Pilot % git remote -v
        main    git@github.com:MFiech/pm-copilot.git (fetch)
        main    git@github.com:MFiech/pm-copilot.git (push)
    5. Checkout back to main.
    6. Do not summarize what you have done. Just wait for my confirmation that I have merged the change.
    7. After the remote merge, pull the latest main version to the local main.
