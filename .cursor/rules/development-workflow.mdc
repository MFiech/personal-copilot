# How do we start working on a new feature?
    1. If you're on other feature branch, stage the changes and checkout to main.
    2. Pull the newest version of main.
    3. Create a new feature branch with descriptive branch name.
    4. Start working on the feature.
    5. Until requested, do not commit the changes automatically.

# How do we push local changes to the remote repository?
    1. Always make sure that you're on a correct feature branch with the changes.
    2. Stage all modified files.
    3. Write a description commit title and description. Make sure the title/description is about all changes on the branch, not only recent changes.
    4. Push the branch to the remote repository.
        myenvmfiech@Michas-MacBook-Pro-2 PM Co-Pilot % git remote -v
        main    git@github.com:MFiech/pm-copilot.git (fetch)
        main    git@github.com:MFiech/pm-copilot.git (push)
    5. Checkout back to main.
    6. In the remote repository, if there are no conflicts, merge the new branch to main.
    7. After the remote merge, pull the latest main version to the local main.
