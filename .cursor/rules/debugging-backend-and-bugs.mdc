Follow these helpful information to to speed up things while debugging issues:
- Docker Container is called "pm-copilot-backend",
- If I provide you with logs in the query, do not query Docker logs until needed (there's often a lot of HTML code that's not important),
- First check in the code what are the debug console logs to know what to look for in the Docker logs.
- Check the MongoDB "conversations" collection and the last couple of documents to see what was saved in the DB and what has not. 
- If you need any FE logs you can't extract on your own, ask for them explicitly.
