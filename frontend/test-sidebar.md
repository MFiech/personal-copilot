# Resizable Email Sidebar Implementation

## Changes Made:

1. **Created ResizableEmailSidebar Component** (`/frontend/src/components/ResizableEmailSidebar.js`)
   - Fixed position sidebar that sticks to the right side of the screen
   - Default width: 240px
   - Resizable between 120px (min) and 640px (max)
   - Drag handle on the left edge with visual indicator on hover
   - Smooth transitions when not actively resizing
   - Content remains exactly the same as the original EmailSidebar

2. **Updated App.js**
   - Replaced EmailSidebar import with ResizableEmailSidebar
   - Added margin-right to main content area that adjusts when sidebar is open
   - Smooth transition for main content when sidebar opens/closes

## Key Features:

- **Resizing**: Click and drag the left edge of the sidebar to resize
- **Visual Feedback**: Drag indicator appears on hover
- **Smooth Transitions**: Main content smoothly adjusts when sidebar opens
- **Persistent Layout**: Sidebar stays fixed to the right, not an overlay
- **Responsive Design**: Content adapts to available space

## Testing:

1. Click on any email to open the sidebar
2. The sidebar should appear on the right as a fixed column (not overlay)
3. Hover over the left edge to see the resize handle
4. Click and drag to resize (120px - 640px range)
5. Main content should adjust to make room for the sidebar

The sidebar now functions as a proper resizable panel rather than a drawer overlay.
