# VeyraX Integration Findings and Resolution

## Original Issues

After extensive testing and code improvements, we initially identified several key issues with the VeyraX API integration:

1. ✅ **API Connection Works**: Your VeyraX API key is valid and can connect to the API.
2. ⚠️ **Missing Gmail Tool**: The Gmail tool was not available or used a different name (`mail` instead of `gmail`).
3. ⚠️ **Calendar Method Issues**: The Google Calendar tool used a different method name (`list_events` instead of `get_events`).
4. ⚠️ **Documentation vs. Reality**: The official VeyraX documentation didn't fully match the implementation details.

## Resolution

Based on the official VeyraX documentation and our testing, we've made these improvements:

| Item | Original | Updated | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| API Base URL | https://veyraxapp.com | https://veyraxapp.com | ✅ Working |
| API Key Header | "Authorization" | "VEYRAX_API_KEY" | ✅ Fixed |
| Gmail/Mail Endpoint | /tool-call/gmail/... | /mail/... | ✅ Fixed |
| Calendar Endpoint | /tool-call/google-calendar/... | /google-calendar/... | ✅ Fixed |
| Request Method | Mix of GET/POST | All POST | ✅ Fixed |
| Parameter Structure | Inconsistent | Following documentation | ✅ Fixed |

## Complete Improvements

1. **Fixed API Endpoints**:
   - Updated Gmail/Mail endpoints to use `/mail/{action}` format
   - Updated Calendar endpoints to use `/google-calendar/{action}` format
   - Removed all references to `/tool-call/` paths

2. **Fixed Authentication**:
   - Changed header from `Authorization: Bearer {key}` to `VEYRAX_API_KEY: {key}`
   - Ensured all requests include `Content-Type: application/json`

3. **Fixed Request Format**:
   - Updated all requests to use POST method
   - Structured parameters according to documentation
   - Added support for empty JSON object `{}` for endpoints with no parameters

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added better error detection and reporting
   - Implemented consistent error response format
   - Added detailed error messages for common issues

5. **Improved Testing**:
   - Created comprehensive test scripts
   - Added detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting
   - Created a verification script for easy setup validation

6. **Better Documentation**:
   - Updated README-VEYRAX.md with correct setup instructions
   - Added examples of using the VeyraX service
   - Added response format documentation

## Using the Integration

To use the VeyraX integration:

1. Make sure your VeyraX API key is set in your `.env` file:
   ```
   VEYRAX_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Make sure Mail and Google Calendar are connected in your VeyraX account.

3. Run the verification script to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify_veyrax_setup.py
   ```

4. In your code, use the VeyraXService to access Mail and Calendar data:
   ```python
   from services.veyrax_service import VeyraXService
   
   veyrax = VeyraXService()
   emails = veyrax.get_recent_emails()
   events = veyrax.get_upcoming_events()
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check:

1. Is your API key correct and set in the `.env` file?
2. Have you connected Mail/Gmail in your VeyraX account?
3. Have you connected Google Calendar in your VeyraX account?
4. Do you have the needed permissions for these services?

Run our diagnostic scripts for detailed information:
```bash
python scripts/simple_veyrax_test.py
python scripts/test_veyrax_connection.py
