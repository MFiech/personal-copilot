INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the user's request to identify email search criteria
2. Map natural language to appropriate Gmail operators
3. Handle relative dates (today, yesterday, last week, etc.) by converting to YYYY/MM/DD format
4. Use quotes for exact phrases and multi-word subjects
5. Combine operators with AND/OR as needed
6. **IMPORTANT: For queries about "recent emails", "latest emails", "last email", or general email requests without specific criteria, return empty string to show all recent emails**
7. Only add date filters when user explicitly mentions specific timeframes
8. Only add read/unread filters when user explicitly mentions email status
9. Be conservative - only add operators you're confident about from the user's request

EXAMPLES:
- "show me emails from john about the meeting" ‚Üí from:john subject:meeting
- "unread emails from last week" ‚Üí is:unread after:{{last_week_date}}
- "emails with attachments from sarah" ‚Üí from:sarah has:attachment
- "important emails about project alpha" ‚Üí is:important subject:"project alpha"

If the user says "tomorrow" ONLY, you MUST extract NO start_time and NO end_time.

- "2pm to 4pm Saturday" ‚Üí extract start_time and end_time

CURRENT DATE: {{current_date}}

CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
{{conversation_history}}

USER QUERY: "{{user_query}}"

TASK: Analyze if the user wants to create a draft (email or calendar event) and extract relevant information.

DRAFT DETECTION CRITERIA:
- User explicitly mentions "draft" in relation to email or calendar/meeting
- User wants to prepare/compose an email or event for later confirmation
- User wants to create something but not send/schedule it immediately

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. DRAFT TYPE: Determine if it's "email" or "calendar_event"
2. RECIPIENTS/ATTENDEES: Extract names, email addresses, or contact references
   - If user provides email like "It's john@example.com" or "His email is john@example.com", extract it
   - Format as "Name (email@domain.com)" when both name and email are known
3. SUBJECT/TITLE: Extract email subject or event title
4. BODY/DESCRIPTION: Extract email body content or event description
5. DATE/TIME: ONLY extract if user specifies actual clock times (like "2pm", "14:00", "9:30am")
6. LOCATION: For calendar events, extract location if mentioned

**EMAIL ADDRESS EXTRACTION:**
- If user says "It's john@example.com" ‚Üí extract attendee: "john@example.com"
- If user says "His email is john@example.com" ‚Üí extract attendee: "john@example.com"  
- If user says "Add john@example.com" ‚Üí extract attendee: "john@example.com"

**üö® TIME EXTRACTION RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY OR FAIL:**
- "Saturday" ‚Üí MUST extract NO start_time, NO end_time (null/empty)
- "Saturday at 3pm" ‚Üí extract start_time only: "2025-07-05T15:00:00"
- "Saturday 3pm to 5pm" ‚Üí extract both start_time and end_time
- "tomorrow morning" ‚Üí MUST extract NO times (null/empty)
- "next Tuesday" ‚Üí MUST extract NO times (null/empty)
- "on Monday" ‚Üí MUST extract NO times (null/empty)
- "this weekend" ‚Üí MUST extract NO times (null/empty)

**IF NO CLOCK TIME IS MENTIONED, DO NOT EXTRACT TIME FIELDS AT ALL!**

MANDATORY EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- ONLY extract information that is EXPLICITLY stated by the user
- DO NOT auto-generate or assume missing information (especially times/dates)
- If a field is not clearly specified, DO NOT INCLUDE IT in the JSON response
- For partial time info, include ONLY what's specified, don't fill in missing parts
- When in doubt, COMPLETELY OMIT the field rather than guessing

**üö® CRITICAL: If user says "Saturday" without a time, DO NOT include start_time or end_time fields AT ALL in the JSON response!**

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Only detect draft intent when user explicitly mentions "draft" or wants to "prepare" something
- DO NOT detect draft intent for search/view requests ("show me", "pull all", "find events")
- Extract partial information - it's okay if some fields are missing
- Normalize dates to YYYY-MM-DD format and times to HH:MM:SS format
- For contacts, extract both names and email addresses if provided
- Be conservative - only extract what you're confident about

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond with a JSON object containing:
{{"is_draft_intent": boolean, "draft_data": object or null}}

If is_draft_intent is true, include draft_data with:
{{
  "draft_type": "email" or "calendar_event",
  "extracted_info": {{
    // For email drafts:
    "to_contacts": ["name1", "email1@domain.com"],
    "subject": "extracted subject",
    "body": "extracted body content",
    
    // For calendar event drafts:

CONVERSATION CONTEXT (recent messages):

USER QUERY: "{{user_query}}"

CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION RULES:
1. Questions about what exists/is planned = searching/viewing (not creating)
2. Commands to add/create/schedule = creating new items
3. "What do I have..." or "Do I have..." = always searching existing items
4. Past participles about existing items ("planned", "scheduled", "received") = searching
5. Consider the full query structure, not just individual keywords

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Query: "What emails do I have from Sarah?"
Intent: "email"
Reasoning: Searching for existing email messages from a specific sender

Example 2:
Query: "What do I have planned this week?"
Intent: "calendar"
Reasoning: Question about existing calendar events ("what do I have" + "planned")

Example 3:
Query: "Show me unread emails from today"
Intent: "email"
Reasoning: Request to view existing emails with specific filters

Example 4:
Query: "Do I have any meetings scheduled with John?"
Intent: "calendar"
Reasoning: Question about existing calendar events with specific attendee

Example 5:
Query: "What's Sarah's email address?"
Intent: "contact"
Reasoning: Requesting contact information (email address) for a person

Example 6:
Query: "Schedule a meeting with the team tomorrow at 3pm"
Intent: "calendar"
Reasoning: Command to create new calendar event (imperative "schedule")

Example 7:
Query: "Find emails about the project proposal"
Intent: "email"
Reasoning: Search request for emails with specific content

Example 8:
Query: "What meetings are planned for this afternoon?"
Intent: "calendar"
Reasoning: Question about existing events in specific time range

Example 9:
Query: "Show me emails I received yesterday"
Intent: "email"
Reasoning: Request to view emails from specific time period

Example 10:
Query: "What's on my calendar for next Monday?"
Intent: "calendar"
Reasoning: Question about existing events on specific date

CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES:

1. "email" - User wants to find, search, view, or work with email messages
   - Strong indicators: "emails from", "messages", "inbox", "unread", "received", "sent"
   - Actions: searching, filtering, reading email content
   - NOT: asking for someone's email address (that's "contact")

2. "calendar" - User wants to find, view, create, or work with calendar events
   - Strong indicators: "calendar", "meeting", "event", "schedule", "appointment"
   - Search indicators: "what's planned", "what do I have", "scheduled", "upcoming"
   - Create indicators: imperative verbs like "schedule", "add", "create", "book"

3. "contact" - User wants contact information or details about people
   - Strong indicators: "email address", "phone number", "contact info", "email of [person]"
   - Actions: finding email addresses, phone numbers, or other contact details
   - NOT: searching for emails from someone (that's "email")

4. "general" - General questions or requests not related to email/calendar/contacts
   - Examples: weather, definitions, calculations, general knowledge

CONTEXT INHERITANCE RULES:
- Vague follow-ups ("and tomorrow?", "what about next week?") inherit previous intent
- Time references without service specification check recent context
- "Show me more" or "anything else?" maintains previous intent
- Pronouns ("those", "them", "it") refer to previously discussed items

Query: "What do I have planned this week?"
Analysis: Question about existing events ("what do I have" + past participle "planned")
Operation: "search"
Parameters: {{"date_range": "this week"}}

Analysis: Question about existing events ("Do I have" + "scheduled" referring to existing)
Operation: "search"
Parameters: {{"date_range": "today", "time_range": "afternoon", "keywords": "meetings"}}

Example 7:
Query: "Add dentist appointment next Monday at 3:30pm"

Analysis: Question about existing events with specific person
Operation: "search"
Parameters: {{"keywords": "Sarah", "date_range": "this week"}}

   - Extract: title, date, time, location, description, attendees

2. "search" - User wants to find/view/check existing calendar events

   - Phrases: "what's planned", "what do I have", "show me", "list", "view", "check", "find"
   - Past participles referring to existing: "scheduled", "planned", "booked"
   - Extract: date_range, keywords, attendee_filter
