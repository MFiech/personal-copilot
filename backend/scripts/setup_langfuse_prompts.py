USER REQUEST: "{{user_query}}"

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the user's request to identify email search criteria
2. Map natural language to appropriate Gmail operators
3. Handle relative dates (today, yesterday, last week, etc.) by converting to YYYY/MM/DD format
4. Use quotes for exact phrases and multi-word subjects
5. Combine operators with AND/OR as needed
6. **IMPORTANT: For queries about "recent emails", "latest emails", "last email", or general email requests without specific criteria, return empty string to show all recent emails**
7. Only add date filters when user explicitly mentions specific timeframes
8. Only add read/unread filters when user explicitly mentions email status
9. Be conservative - only add operators you're confident about from the user's request

EXAMPLES:
- "show me emails from john about the meeting" ‚Üí from:john subject:meeting
- "unread emails from last week" ‚Üí is:unread after:{{last_week_date}}
- "emails with attachments from sarah" ‚Üí from:sarah has:attachment
- "important emails about project alpha" ‚Üí is:important subject:"project alpha"
- "emails from gmail.com domain yesterday" ‚Üí from:gmail.com after:{{yesterday_date}} before:{{today_date}}
- "show my emails" ‚Üí (empty string)

- "latest emails" ‚Üí (empty string)
- "recent emails" ‚Üí (empty string)

CURRENT DATE: {{current_date}}

CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
{{conversation_history}}

USER QUERY: "{{user_query}}"

TASK: Analyze if the user wants to create a draft (email or calendar event) and extract relevant information.

DRAFT DETECTION CRITERIA:
- User explicitly mentions "draft" in relation to email or calendar/meeting
- User wants to prepare/compose an email or event for later confirmation
- User wants to create something but not send/schedule it immediately

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. DRAFT TYPE: Determine if it's "email" or "calendar_event"
2. RECIPIENTS/ATTENDEES: Extract names, email addresses, or contact references
   - If user provides email like "It's john@example.com" or "His email is john@example.com", extract it
   - Format as "Name (email@domain.com)" when both name and email are known
3. SUBJECT/TITLE: Extract email subject or event title
4. BODY/DESCRIPTION: Extract email body content or event description
5. DATE/TIME: ONLY extract if user specifies actual clock times (like "2pm", "14:00", "9:30am")
6. LOCATION: For calendar events, extract location if mentioned

**EMAIL ADDRESS EXTRACTION:**
- If user says "It's john@example.com" ‚Üí extract attendee: "john@example.com"
- If user says "His email is john@example.com" ‚Üí extract attendee: "john@example.com"  
- If user says "Add john@example.com" ‚Üí extract attendee: "john@example.com"

**üö® TIME EXTRACTION RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY OR FAIL:**
- "Saturday" ‚Üí MUST extract NO start_time, NO end_time (null/empty)
- "Saturday at 3pm" ‚Üí extract start_time only: "2025-07-05T15:00:00"
- "Saturday 3pm to 5pm" ‚Üí extract both start_time and end_time
- "tomorrow morning" ‚Üí MUST extract NO times (null/empty)
- "next Tuesday" ‚Üí MUST extract NO times (null/empty)
- "on Monday" ‚Üí MUST extract NO times (null/empty)
- "this weekend" ‚Üí MUST extract NO times (null/empty)

**IF NO CLOCK TIME IS MENTIONED, DO NOT EXTRACT TIME FIELDS AT ALL!**

MANDATORY EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- ONLY extract information that is EXPLICITLY stated by the user
- DO NOT auto-generate or assume missing information (especially times/dates)
- If a field is not clearly specified, DO NOT INCLUDE IT in the JSON response
- For partial time info, include ONLY what's specified, don't fill in missing parts
- When in doubt, COMPLETELY OMIT the field rather than guessing

**üö® CRITICAL: If user says "Saturday" without a time, DO NOT include start_time or end_time fields AT ALL in the JSON response!**

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Only detect draft intent when user explicitly mentions "draft" or wants to "prepare" something
- Extract partial information - it's okay if some fields are missing
- Normalize dates to YYYY-MM-DD format and times to HH:MM:SS format
- For contacts, extract both names and email addresses if provided
- Be conservative - only extract what you're confident about

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond with a JSON object containing:
{{"is_draft_intent": boolean, "draft_data": object or null}}

If is_draft_intent is true, include draft_data with:
{{
  "draft_type": "email" or "calendar_event",
  "extracted_info": {{
    // For email drafts:
    "to_contacts": ["name1", "email1@domain.com"],

CONVERSATION CONTEXT (recent messages):
{{conversation_context}}

USER QUERY: "{{user_query}}"

CLASSIFICATION TASK:
Analyze the user's query considering the conversation context. Classify the intent as one of:

1. "email" - User wants to find, search, or work with emails/messages
   Examples: "show me emails", "check my inbox", "emails from John", "unread messages"

2. "calendar" - User wants to find, search, or work with calendar events/meetings
   Examples: "what's on my calendar", "meetings today", "schedule for this week", "upcoming events"

3. "contact" - User wants to find, search, or get information about contacts/people
   Examples: "what's the email of John Doe", "contact info for Sarah", "find contact Dawid", "email address of Mike", "all emails of John" (meaning email addresses), "phone number of Sarah"

4. "general" - General questions, conversation, or non-email/calendar/contact requests
   Examples: "how's the weather", "what is AI", "tell me a joke"

IMPORTANT CONTEXT RULES:
- If previous messages were about emails/calendar/contacts and current query is vague ("and this week?", "show me more", "what about tomorrow?"), inherit that context
- Time-related queries without explicit service ("today", "this week", "tomorrow") should prefer calendar if recent context suggests it
- Follow-up questions typically maintain the same intent as previous queries
- Queries asking for "email of [person]" or "emails of [person]" or "contact info" should be classified as "contact", not "email"
- "Emails from [person]" or "messages from [person]" should be classified as "email" (searching for messages)
- "Email addresses of [person]" or "all emails of [person]" should be classified as "contact" (contact information)
