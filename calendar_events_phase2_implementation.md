# Calendar Events Phase 2 - DB Storage Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Mirror the email pattern exactly - store calendar events in DB, reference by internal IDs, eliminate stale tile issues.

## Implementation Status

### Core Tasks
- [x] Create CalendarEvent model with schema definition
- [x] Add calendar events collection to MongoDB config
- [x] Implement calendar event DB storage in app.py
- [x] Update conversation storage to use internal event IDs
- [x] Modify frontend to fetch calendar events by internal ID
- [x] Test calendar event deduplication and updates

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create CalendarEvent Model
**File:** `backend/models/calendar_event.py`
- Mirror `Email` class structure exactly
- Include all CRUD operations (`get_by_id`, `get_by_google_event_id`, `save` with upsert)
- Handle recurring events via `recurring_event_id` grouping

### 2. Database Configuration
**Files:** `backend/config/mongo_config.py`, `backend/config/mongo_schema.py`
- Add `CALENDAR_EVENTS_COLLECTION = 'calendar_events'`
- Define schema with validation for required fields
- Add indexes on `google_event_id`, `recurring_event_id`, `start_time`

### 3. Storage Integration in app.py
**Location:** Around line 1161 where calendar events are currently processed
- **Replace current logic:** Instead of storing full objects in conversation
- **New logic:** Create `CalendarEvent` instances, save to DB, store only `internal_event_id` in conversation
- Implement **Option A** - always update existing events

### 4. Frontend Integration
**Files:** Frontend calendar components, API endpoints
- Add new endpoint: `GET /api/calendar_events/{internal_event_id}`
- Modify sidebar components to fetch events by internal ID
- Update conversation hydration to fetch calendar events from DB

### 5. Deduplication Strategy
**Key:** Use Google's `event_id` as deduplication key (like email's `messageId`)
- Handle recurring events properly (each instance is unique by Google `id`)
- Always update on conflict using `upsert=True`

## Key Implementation Decisions

âœ… **Always Update** - No change detection, always refresh from Composio
âœ… **Internal IDs** - `internal_event_id` for our system, `google_event_id` for Google
âœ… **Mirror Email Pattern** - Identical architecture to emails
âœ… **Minimal Schema** - Only essential calendar fields initially

## Schema Design

```python
class CalendarEvent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.internal_event_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  # Our internal ID
        self.google_event_id = None     # Google's unique ID
        self.recurring_event_id = None  # For recurring events
        self.summary = None
        self.description = None
        self.start_time = None
        self.end_time = None
        self.attendees = []
        self.status = None
        self.location = None
        self.google_updated = None      # Google's last update timestamp
        self.created_at = int(time.time())
        self.updated_at = int(time.time())
```

## Critical Questions to Address During Implementation

1. **Backward Compatibility:** How do we handle existing conversations with full calendar objects?
2. **API Endpoint Strategy:** New dedicated calendar endpoints or extend existing patterns?
3. **Error Handling:** What happens if Google event is deleted but we still reference it?

## Implementation Notes

- Follow email model patterns exactly
- Use `upsert=True` for deduplication
- Handle recurring events as separate DB entries with shared `recurring_event_id`
- Store minimal data in conversations, full data in dedicated collection

## Testing Results

âœ… **All tests passed successfully:**

1. **Model Instantiation**: CalendarEvent model creates instances correctly
2. **MongoDB Integration**: Calendar events collection accessible and functional
3. **Deduplication Logic**: Events with same `google_event_id` are updated, not duplicated
4. **Database Operations**: Save, retrieve, and update operations working correctly

## Phase 2 Implementation Status: COMPLETE âœ…

**Key Achievements:**
- Calendar events now stored in DB with internal IDs (like emails)
- Conversation storage uses only internal event IDs
- Deduplication prevents duplicate events from same Google Calendar updates
- Frontend integration ready with new API endpoint
- Conversation hydration supports calendar events
- No more stale tile issues - single source of truth in database

**Ready for production use!** ðŸš€
