# Calendar Test Scenario - Implementation Ready

## Status: ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING

I've implemented the missing calendar functionality based on your requirements. Here's what was fixed and added:

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend UI Enhancements
- **Added delete button** to calendar events in the ToolTile component
- Calendar events now show a delete button (üóëÔ∏è) on hover in the bottom-right corner
- Added proper CSS styling for the new calendar delete button
- Updated ToolResults.js to pass the delete handler to calendar events

### 2. Backend Time Modification Parsing
- **Fixed "move 3 hours later" issue** - the system now intelligently parses time modification requests
- Added `_parse_time_modification()` method that supports patterns like:
  - "move 3 hours later"
  - "shift 30 minutes earlier" 
  - "2 hours later"
  - "45 minutes earlier"
- Proper timezone handling to preserve original event timezone
- Direct integration with Composio calendar update API

### 3. Enhanced Anchored Item Handling
- Calendar anchored items now properly handle time modification actions
- Real-time calendar updates through Composio API
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Test Scenario (Updated)

**Branch:** `feature/calendar-ui-enhancements` (pushed to remote)

### Scenario Steps:
1. **Create Event**: Query "Add a new test event tomorrow at 2pm" 
   - Should create event and show in calendar results

2. **Anchor Event**: Manually select the created event as anchored via UI
   - Click the anchor icon on the calendar event tile

3. **Modify Event**: Query "Move the event 3 hours later" 
   - ‚úÖ Should now work correctly (was failing before)
   - Should move event from 2pm to 5pm
   - Should show success confirmation

4. **Delete Event**: Use the new delete button in UI
   - ‚úÖ Delete button now visible on calendar events (was missing before)
   - Hover over calendar event to see delete button (üóëÔ∏è)
   - Click to delete (currently shows placeholder message)

## What You Can Test Now

1. **Time Modification**: The "move 3 hours later" issue is fixed
2. **UI Delete Button**: Calendar events now have delete buttons
3. **Various Time Patterns**: Try different phrases:
   - "shift 30 minutes earlier"
   - "move 1 hour later" 
   - "2 hours earlier"

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

To complete the delete functionality, you'll need to:
1. Implement the actual calendar delete API call (currently placeholder)
2. Add proper error handling for delete operations
3. Update the UI to refresh after deletion

## Files Modified
- `backend/services/composio_service.py` - Added time parsing and anchored item handling
- `frontend/src/components/ToolTile.js` - Added delete button for calendar events
- `frontend/src/components/ToolTile.css` - Added delete button styling
- `frontend/src/components/ToolResults.js` - Added delete handler

The implementation is ready for your testing when you return!
